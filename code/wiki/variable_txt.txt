# Variable Standardisation

Fundamental to the data collation program is the concept of data standardisation. All data contained within the data lake is processed nightly into standardised data products.

As part of this standardisation, all incoming variables need to be converted into a common variable name and unit. To facilitate this, a global variable translation glossary is being developed, which will allow the data engineers to quickly and transparently create importation scripts to process new datasets.
