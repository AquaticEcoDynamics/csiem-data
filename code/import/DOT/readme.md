# DOT Tide Data Import

Data has been imported from 4 sites:

- Fremantle
- Barrack St Jetty
- Hillarys
- Mangleds Bay

All four sites have been downloaded from DOT and currently don't include any live data. No data correction has been addded, nor has there been any shift in Datum. The only correction applied is when there are two sensors (a & B) sensor a has been filled by sensor b when data is missing.
