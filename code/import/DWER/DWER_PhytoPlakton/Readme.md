# DWER Phytoplankton Species


# DWER Phytoplankton Group
    Creates a holding csv file for each combination of site and group, this file contains the all data points, of each species in this group. This means that their are multiple rows associated with the same time value. I then I run another script that runs through and finds duplicate time values and adds them to give the concentration of that group at that given time.
