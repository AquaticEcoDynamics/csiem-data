The variable names as can be seen in the folder labeled Variable Naming have been
chosen to mimic WIR conventions. The file paths have been hard coded to appropriate locations
in the Projects2 network drive which can then be (eventually) ran through hydro user on davy.
as of now (29/02/2024) I ssh into davy then ssh into sci-nix which has matlab installed and am able to run.

From a data transperacy perspective, I havent touched the data for most of the entries however in the case of Kwinana data,
its easier to just stitch the Lat and Long in after the fact than rename the data that came in so the names match perfectly.

I found the coordinates in the remastered sharepoint copy of the sediment data, this was done in terms of eastings and northings,
this was converted to lat and long using https://www.zonums.com/online/coords/cotrans.php?module=14 and creating a seperate csv as to not edit
the data that comes in.
