Header have not been finished
The 27GB file has been interoogated and the unique sites and subsites have been sorted into unstructured text file, this is the output of some C code that stores the sites and subsites in two seperate data structures and a list of these structures is made. 

The Sites have not been included in the site key because if both are included there are double ups of ID's (some subsite id's match site id's, but they are different places) The Sites and their subsites can be found in a text/csv file mentioned above.

There are a few sites that dont have lat and lon in the data file.
