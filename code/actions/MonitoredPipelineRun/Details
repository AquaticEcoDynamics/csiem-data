At 2:33pm i am starting the memory tracker from a terminal ssh, not vs code
Likewise i will run the bash script "run_Lac.sh" in the same way on a different terminal
after this i will check the log file for two hydro logins and see their process numbers ect.
        I have now saved the tail of the log containing these details
