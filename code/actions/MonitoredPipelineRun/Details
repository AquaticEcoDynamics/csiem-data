At 2:33pm i am starting the memory tracker from a terminal ssh, not vs code
Likewise i will run the bash script "run_Lac.sh" in the same way on a different terminal
after this i will check the log file for two hydro logins and see their process numbers ect.
        I have now saved the tail of the log containing these details


*update*
we discussed piping the stdout and stderr of the initial bash script, because at the moment i am only piping matlab output.

It crashed because i made a type error when i changed wamsi 3 sedpsd, that is fixed and running all of the imports that didnt finish.
this is starting at 8:50 am 23-01-2025 (PID 1326326)
